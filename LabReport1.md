      ![Image](cdwithnoarg.png)
     
     `cd`
     
      Absolute path: /Users/wenxili/Desktop/UCSD/CSE 15L
     
      The command brings me to the home directory as after I executed cd with no arg the absolute path become /Users/wenxili

  1. cd
      ![Image](cdtoadirct.png)
     
      `cd Commanded`
     
      Absolute path: /Users/wenxili/Desktop/UCSD/CSE 15L
     
      The command brings me into the file I specified (Commandcd) as after I executed cd the absolute path become /Users/wenxili/Desktop/UCSD/CSE 15L/Commandcd
     
      The output is not an error.
     

# Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
  1. cd
     ![Image](cdtoafile.png)
     
     `cd Commandcd/cdtoadirct.png`
     
     Absolute path: /Users/wenxili/Desktop/UCSD/CSE 15L
     
     The command produces an error since cd wants to get into a folder but cdtoadirct.png is an actual file.
     
     The output is an error since cd need to be into a directory, cannot directly open a file.
